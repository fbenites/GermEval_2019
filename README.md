# GermEval_2019
Winning approach to GermEval Task 1, subtask B, hierarchical classification of Blurbs (with 343 labels).

Here you can find the data, the script and a jupyter notebook.

To reproduce the results please create a virtual environment and load the packages in requirements.txt.
Also unpack the data (gunzip) and then you can run in python or jupyter environment (with the virtual env).
You can find a detailed description in my [Blog post](https://fbenites.github.io/GermEval/index.html).
